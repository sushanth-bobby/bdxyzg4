Welcome to my personal site!

This site is built using 🡪 GatsbyJS using starter pack from [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog).

In this site, i post about my interests and stuff i do.

## 🥊 Development & Testing

### Development procedures

1. Create a monthly git branch and start making changes 
    ```
    # Every month create a new branch August2022(First Character Uppercase followed by year)
    Create and Checkout : git checkout -b August2022
    Checkout            : git checkout August2022
    ```

2. Test the site
    ```
    gatsby clean                # Deletes .cache, public folders

    gatsby develop              # Less outputs
    ```

## 🚀 Deployment

I am using google firebase hosting for deployment and follow instructions in this [link](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-to-firebase/). 

1. Merge the change from feature branch to master/main 
    ```
    git checkout main
    git merge August2022 -m "Merging August 2022 : Update 1"
    ```

2. Prepare Gatsby Deployment 
    ```
    gatsby clean
    gatsby build --verbose
    gatsby serve
    ```

3. Verify the counts of links in Chrome Console as sometimes it tend to miss pages without warning. Basically go to chrome and inspect on a blog link and get the CSS class value and paste that below, its dynamic. It changes, so for every build there will be new one. Get the count and see "Is that the number of pages you have in your site". If YES, proceed to next step. 

    ```
    document.querySelectorAll(".css-1dkmnim").length
    ```

4. Deploy to Firebase Hosting 
    ```
    firebase serve --only hosting
    firebase deploy -m "August 2022 : Update 1"
    ```

5. Push the changes to GitHub
    ```
    git add . 
    git commit -m "August 2022 : Update 1"
    git push 
    
    # DONT DO THIS AFTER GIT PUSH : When some files are forgotten to add
    git add .
    git commit --amend --no-edit
    ```
